# Populating the database #:
1. To populate the database you need to use this command:
"\i C:/path/to/DML.sql"
(Replace 'C:/path/to/DML.sql' with the actual file path)


## Testing Instructions ##: 

1. To test the code you first need to alter the get_connection()
function. 
2. Change the database, and password to your database and password
3. Scroll down to the main function and from there you can make
any changes to to the function calls there.
4. You should be able to see all operations done perfectly

### Compile Instructions ###:

1. To compile the CRUD.py file, you need to have python 3 installed
2. If you already have it installed, you need to install 
psycopg2 with the command "pip install psycopg2"
(Get rid of the quotation marks when installing)
3. Once installed, run the python file either on the command line
or through your IDE 
(I personally would recommend using the command line)
4. If you are using the command line use the command:
"python3 CRUD.py"
